The scheme's benefits are therefore paid directly to bank accounts in the girls' names, leaving the decision of utilizing the money in their hands.\n\nTo reinforce the positive impact of increased education and delayed marriages, the scheme also works to enhance the social power and self-esteem of girls through a targeted behavior change communication strategy. The communication strategy not only builds awareness of the scheme, but includes adolescent-friendly approaches like events, competitions, and Kanyashree clubs, and the endorsement of strong women figures as role models to promote social and psychological empowerment.\n\nAs more and more girls remain in school, it is envisaged that they will use the opportunity to gain skills and knowledge to help them become economically independent. Even if girls do get married soon after they turn 18, it is expected that their education and enhanced social and emotional development will give them a better foundation for their adult lives. And over time, as entire generations of women enter marriages only after they have some degree of economic independence, it is expected that the practice of child marriage will be completely eradicated. Women will attain their right to health, education, and socio-economic equality.\n\nThe main objective of the scheme is to prevent child marriage and promote education among girls. It also aims to improve the health and nutrition of girls and empower them by building their skills and capacities.\n\nThe scheme is implemented through a network of school teachers, community workers, and government officials.

        "details": "Details\nAgriculture occupies the primary position in the economy of the state of Assam. Over 70% of the state\u2019s population relies on agriculture as farmers, as agricultural labourers, or both for their livelihood. Although agriculture in Assam is characterized by stagnation, low productivity and frequent occurrence of floods, and low levels of public and private investment. The small and fragmented land holdings and frequent floods in the state are a causative factor for farmers to have lower income and agricultural activities become non-remunerative in the State. To boost agricultural productivity, it is pertinent to make interventions through financial assistance to poor farmers. Hence, the finance minister of Assam had announced to assist the farmers to promote the use of scientific farm implements. To encourage the farmer to procure and use such implements, the Department of Agriculture proposed a scheme \u201cMukhya Mantri Sa Sajuli Yojana\u201d (Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme) for the purpose and launched in FY 2018-19. \nThe scheme \u201cMukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana\u201d is a State Owned Priority Development (SOPD) scheme and the main purpose of launching this scheme for farmers is their holistic development by implementing several farm mechanization schemes. With the help of \u201cMukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana\u201d the government aims to increase farm productivity in the limited land to meet the expanding demand for farm produce and ensure higher income for farmers. As of now, the usage of scientific tools in cultivation is very limited in the state of Assam. So, the state govt. of Assam is making every possible effort through Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme to ensure the economic growth of rural farmers. Under this scheme, the following is proposed:\n1. \u20b9 5000/- will be provided to each farmer\n2. The number of beneficiaries will be a total of 5 lakh farmers.\n3. The assistance is to procure farm tools/farm implements.\n4. Scheme will be implemented on Direct Benefit Transfer by electronic transfer into the accounts of the beneficiaries.\n5.

Sour Badhbandi (Solar Fencing): Monkey and wildlife menace causes huge losses to crops annually in the State. The present practice of crop protection by manual guarding did not ensure 100 percent crop protection. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme \u201cMukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana\u201d in the name of Solar Fencing. Under this scheme, a subsidy of 85% is being provided if three or more farmers opt to install solar fencing, and if farmers opt to install solar fencing on individual land then an 80% subsidy is being provided. The fence is energized with the help of solar power. Current fences around the farms will be sufficient to keep away stray animals, wild animals, and monkeys from the farms.\n2.

In order to mitigate the losses caused by hail storms the new scheme \u201cKrishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana (Anti-Hail Net Structure)\u201d was started by the State Government in 2020-21 and implemented through the Department of Agriculture.

The schemes will primarily benefit farmers helping them to substantially, reduce the quantitative and qualitative losses to their vegetable produce. Financial assistance maximum of up to 80% is being provided to the eligible farmer for an area coverage maximum of up to 5000 sqm. The monetary gains are expected to be approximately 15-20 crores annually with significant contributions to the state GDP.\n3. Green House Renovation Scheme: Farmers of the state have demanded that there should be a scheme to replace the Poly sheets. Therefore, the Government of Himachal Pradesh introduced a scheme \u201cMukhya Mantri Green House Renovation Scheme\u201d in the year 2017-18. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme \u201cMukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana\u201d as a component namely Green House Renovation.

There is no upper limit for building homes in a particular village as it entirely depends on the number of fishermen residing. States through this scheme ensure equal distribution of houses among all fishermen. Also, this government-backed scheme dictates the house construction with a base area within 35 sq. mt. Also, the cost must not exceed \u20b975,000.\n\nConstruction of Common Facility\nThis government-backed scheme ensures building a community hall in some instances if there are more than 75 houses in a village. This scheme will build a community hall (with two toilets and a tube well) with a base area measuring 200 sq. mt. and within \u20b92 lakh.  Fishermen can use this community hall as a mending shed and a drying yard.\n\nAssurance of Clean Drinking Water\nThis scheme offers a tube well for every 20 houses. Also, depending on the requirement, the number of tube wells is increased. In addition, this scheme provides an alternative option where tubewell installation is not possible.\n\nInsurance Facility\n(For Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen)- This scheme provides fisherfolk or licensed or identified or registered with the States or Union Territory \u20b950,000 in case of death or permanent total disability. Also, this scheme provides \u20b925,000 for partial permanent disability.\n\nHere, the insurance cover will continue for 12 months, and FISHCOPFED would take out a policy. Also, under this scheme, the affected fishermen will have to pay an annual premium worth \u20b915 (per head). Here, the Central Government will pay 50%, and the State Government will pay the remaining 50% subsidy as grants-in-aid. In the case of Union Territories, the Central Government will bear a 100% premium.\n\nOn the other hand, those States/UT\u2019s, which subscribed to this Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen through FISHCOPFED, will get a Central share of assistance (100% premium for Union Territories) directly through FISHCOPFED and not through States/UT\u2019s.\n\nSaving cum relief\nThe National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen further offers a savings cum relief scheme. This scheme component collects \u20b975 from marine fishermen for 8 months in a year. Total \u20b9600 needs to be collected to match an equal amount worth \u20b9600 provided by the State and Central Government to segregate on a 50:50 basis. If any fishermen fail to make payment, the authorities will refund the paid amount with interest at the end of the 4th month. Also, the \u2018lean months\u2019 provisions vary from a coastal area or marine area, which FISHCOPFED decides entirely.\n\nNow that individuals know about this government scheme for fishermen, i.e. the National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen, they avail funds and construct houses of their own.",

Creating awareness about the capabilities of differently-abled persons, construction aimed at improving accessibility, purchase of equipment to enrich learning, etc., are the broad categories of assistance under this scheme. \nSpecific Objectives of HEPSN\n The specific objectives of the HEPSN Scheme are as follows: \nTo provide equal educational opportunities to differently-abled persons in higher education institutions.\nTo create awareness among the functionaries of higher education about the specific educational needs of differently-abled persons. \nTo equip higher education institutions with the facilities to provide access to differently-abled persons.\nTo provide special devices to higher education institutions that will augment the learning experiences of differently-abled persons. \nTo monitor the implementation of all existing and future legislation and policies, which are about higher education of differently-abled persons. ",
        "benefits": "Benefits\nProvision of Facilities and Financial assistance \nThe HEPSN scheme has three components. They are enumerated as follows: \nComponent 1: Establishment of Enabling Units for differently-abled Persons \nTo develop awareness in the higher education system and also to provide necessary guidance and counseling to differently-abled persons, it is proposed to establish resource units in colleges in the country, which will be called Enabling Units. The functions of this Enabling Unit will be to: \n1. Facilitate admission of differently-abled persons in various courses; \n2. Provide guidance and counseling to differently-abled individuals; \n3. Create awareness about the needs of differently-abled persons, and other general issues concerning their learning; and \n4. Assist differently-abled graduates to gain successful employment in the public as well as private sectors. \nThe special unit will be coordinated by a faculty member to be nominated by the head of the institution. He/she will work as an honorary coordinator for which a token honorarium of Rs. 4000/- per month will be paid. The unit will also have a budgetary provision of \u20b9 50,000/per year towards general administration, stationery, and contingencies, and to avail the services of experts and personnel for organizing awareness programs, counseling sessions, etc., for efficient and independent functioning in order to achieve its objectives.\n\nComponent 2: Providing Access to Differently-abled Persons\n\nThe UGC will make a one-time grant of up to \u20b9 5,00,000 per college during the Plan period so that the colleges can address the accessibility issues pertaining to disability and make special arrangements in the environment for their mobility and independent functioning.\nThe colleges address accessibility-related issues as per the stipulations of the Persons with Disabilities Act 1995.\nThe colleges ensure that all existing structures as well as future construction projects in their campuses are made disabled-friendly. \nThe institutes create special facilities such as ramps, rails, and special toilets, and make other necessary changes to suit the special needs of differently-abled persons.\n\nComponent 3: Providing Special Equipment to Augment Educational Services for Differently-abled Persons \nDifferently-abled persons require special aids and appliances for their daily functioning. These aids are available through various schemes of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. In addition to the procurement of assistive devices through these schemes, higher education institutions may also need special learning and assessment devices to help differently-abled students enrolled in higher education. In addition, visually challenged students need Readers. Availability of devices such as computers with screen reading software, low-vision aids, scanners, mobility devices, etc., in the institutes, would enrich the educational experiences of differently-abled persons. Therefore, colleges are encouraged to procure such devices and provide the facility of Readers for visually challenged students. The UGC will provide an ad hoc one-time grant of up to \u20b91,50,000  per college during the Twelfth Plan period",
        "eligibility": "Eligibility\nThe college applying for a grant for any one of the components of the scheme should have enrolled disabled persons, including persons with visual impairment, hearing impairment, locomotor disability, etc., in various courses of the institute.

Households without shelter\n2. Destitute/ living on alms\n3. Manual scavengers\n4. Primitive Tribal Groups\n5. Legally released bonded laborer\nPrioritisation within the Universe\ni.  There will be multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority will first be assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others. \nii.  To begin with, households will be prioritized based on houselessness followed by the number of rooms; zero, one, and two rooms, in that order. \niii.  In a particular social category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others, households that are houseless or living in houses with a lower number of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses with a higher number of rooms.\nWithin the above priority groups, households that fulfill the criteria of \"compulsory inclusion\", will be further elevated. Automatically included households shall not rank lower than other households within a priority group. Inter-se priority within the two subgroups viz. households which are automatically included and otherwise will be determined based on their cumulative deprivation scores. \nThe scores will be calculated from the socio-economic parameters given below with each having equal weight:\ni. Households with no adult member between ages 16 to 59\nii. Female-headed households with no adult male member between ages 16 to 59\niii. Households with no literate adult above 25 years\niv. Households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member\nv. Landless Households deriving the major part of their income from manual casual labor\nvi. Households with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher within the subgroups.\nNote: To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation parameters in the SECC data will be used for identifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas.\nEarmarking of Targets - \nFor SC/ST:\n60% of the target allocated to each State/ UT should be earmarked for SC/STs, subject to the availability of eligible beneficiaries. Within earmarked targets, the proportion of SC and ST is to be decided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. Further, the States/ UTs would be allowed to interchange targets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of the category and it is certified as such. In case all eligible SC and ST households are covered, the State/ UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries from the 'Other' categories included in the Permanent Wait List drawn from SECC 2011.\nFor Minorities:\nFurther, as far as possible, 15% of the total fund would be earmarked for Minorities at the National Level for households. The allocation of targets for Minorities among the States/UTs will be on the basis of the proportionate rural population of Minorities in the respective State/UT as per Census 2011 data. Minorities notified under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 are to be considered eligible for receiving benefits against Minority earmarks.\nFor PwDs:\nAccordingly, in the scheme of PMAY-G, while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries who are to be provided assistance, households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded additional deprivation score so that such households are given priority while allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, of 1995, the States to the extent possible, may ensure that 3% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among persons with disabilities.\nTie Breaker\nIn case there is a tie with more than one household within a subgroup having the same deprivation score, the households will be ranked according to priority on the basis of the following parameters:\ni. Households with widows and next-of-kin of members of defence/paramilitary/police forces killed in action.\nii. Households where a member is suffering from leprosy or cancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV).\niii. Households with a single girl child.\niv.

The government of Telangana provides a subsidy of 75% of the total premium amount for all farmers.\nSum insured: The sum insured under the scheme is based on the value of the crop and the area cultivated. The minimum sum insured is Rs. 5,000 per acre, and the maximum sum insured is Rs. 1,50,000 per acre.\nCoverage: The Rythu Bima Scheme covers crops such as paddy, cotton, maize, chilies, turmeric, and other vegetables and fruits.\nClaims: In case of crop damage, the farmer can claim compensation equal to the sum insured. The claim process is simple, and the payment is made directly to the farmer's bank account.\n\nThe main objective of the Farmers Group Life Insurance Scheme (Rythu Bima), is to provide financial relief and social security to the family members/ dependents, in case of the loss of a farmer\u2019s life due to any reason. In the event of the loss of the farmer's life, their families are facing severe financial problems even for their day-to-day needs. \n\nThe farmer's Group Life Insurance Scheme ensures financial security and relief to the bereaved members of the farmer\u2019s family. Farmers in the age group of 18 to 59 years are eligible for enrollment under the scheme.

USD 6928) is deposited into the designated nominee account within (10) days. \n\nOverall, This scheme has a tremendous impact on the lives of the bereaved families and helps their livelihoods since most of them are resource-poor small farmers and belong to weaker sections of society.

It emphasizes the importance of vocational training and encourages individuals to enroll in courses aligned with industry needs. By promoting skill development in sectors such as healthcare, tourism, agriculture, IT, and manufacturing, the scheme ensures that participants acquire relevant skills that enhance their employability prospects.",

The mission has initiated this scheme that aims at bringing these children to the mainstream of society.\n            The statistics reveal that in Kerala, around 75,000 children below 18 years are living in orphanages. Around 1500 orphanages are functioning in Kerala. Almost 80- 90% of the children in orphanages have families and relatives. Many orphans and vulnerable children slip further into poverty once the family\u2019s main breadwinner stops working or dies. There is nothing more traumatic for a child than to see a parent die. Added to this tragedy is the loss of adult guidance and protection. Children without proper adult care are more likely to be abused & exploited.\n            Children in this category include orphans, abandoned children, children who have lost their parents in war, communal riots, natural disasters, accidents, etc. They are not properly fed; they have no shelter, nutritious food, health care, education, or any recreation. Most of them are facing economic and social exploitation. They are deprived of the love and affection of the family and are often unwanted by family members.\nObjectives of the Scheme:\nTo identify the orphaned children in the community.\nTo assess and prioritize children in the greatest need.\nTo provide social protection to highly vulnerable groups of orphans by strengthening traditional family and community systems for protecting and absorbing orphans.\nTo improve the basic education, social integration, and nutrition of the most vulnerable groups of orphans towards the levels of other children in the community.\nTo encourage families to live their children within the family setup rather than sending them to orphanages.\nTo extend a helping hand to these orphan families by way of providing financial assistance for the education of children.",

Under the scheme, financial assistance is provided to women of Below Poverty Line (BPL) families to find self-employment, whose husbands have died/abandoned, and who have to take care of their sons/children with severe physical and mental challenges.\nParents of severely mentally retarded and differently-abled persons require emotional strength and flexibility. Older parents can find themselves overwhelmed by various medical, caregiving, and financial responsibilities. Physically Handicapped/Mentally Retarded (PH/MR) persons always need special care and attention since they cannot perform their day-to-day activities without someone else\u2019s assistance. Sometimes it can be quite challenging for older parents in BPL families, especially mothers, who have to take care of household tasks and work apart from taking care of MR persons.\nLooking after such a Mentally challenged/PH person is expensive. These expenses can arise from medical equipment and supplies, medical care, caregiving expenses, specialized transportation, etc. Even though an amount of \u20b9600/- is being provided as \u201cAswasakiranam Pension\u201d to caregivers (family members) of bedridden PH/MR persons, it cannot cover the expenses completely. Single mothers face tremendous challenges. Often, a custodial parent must fulfill the roles of primary provider and caregiver without the benefit of a partner.

It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.\nNodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):\nThe Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the Guidelines, and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Fellows to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows:\n1. Group-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums & Galleries\n2. Group-B: Archives, Libraries and General Fellowship\n3. Group-C: Anthropology & Sociology\n4. Group D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary Arts\nScope of the Scheme:\nThe scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Fellows of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the \u2018Nodal Institution\u2019 for each project, and the Fellows will be attached/anchored to that institution.\nDuration of the Fellowship:\nThe duration of the Fellowship will be for a maximum period of two years.\nIn exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken.

However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.\nAdministration of the Scheme:\nThe total number of Fellowships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Fellows to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Fellows, through outsourcing or Consultants.

However, with respect to Fellows from Universities, colleges, Research institutes, or Government setups HRA will be paid by the Parent Organization as per entitlement.\nThe MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure in this regard from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.\nIn respect of Non-MoC Institutions, the Ministry of Culture will reimburse the House Rent Allowance directly to Fellows on submission of rent receipts (in original) to the Participating Institutions who will verify and forward the same to the Ministry for reimbursement.\nSettling Allowance:\nA Fellow from outstation will be given, if required, a lump sum grant of \u20b91.00 lakh as settling allowance for packing/transportation, etc., of his personal belongings from the old station to the new station of his stay during the tenure of Fellowship, if he moves station or otherwise transports books and academic effects.\nAllowance of an equal amount will also be given at the conclusion of the Fellowship for moving out of station.

In this regard, Non-MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure and thereafter seek reimbursement from the Ministry after submission of certified copies of Bills along with justification.\nSupport to Fellows:\nInfrastructural support will be provided by the Nodal Institution to the Fellows to enable them to conduct their research.

However, the proportion of foreigners will not normally exceed one\u2013third of the total fellowships awarded in a year.\nNote 01: Interested Fellows are required to enclose a research proposal prepared on the guidelines provided in Appendix A.\nNote 02: Fellows are also required to prepare a short write-up on how the proposed research would be beneficial for the respective nodal institution.\nNote 03: The honour and the honorarium are both of a very high order; the Institution Level Search-cum-Screening Committee (ILSSC) of the sponsoring institution and the National Selection Committee may keep these in mind while recommending/ selecting the Tagore National Fellows.\nNote 04: In short, a person selected for the Tagore National Fellowship should be one who has already become a \u2018legend\u2019 in his area of work or is regarded very highly. It is appropriate that those who do not come near this description may not apply or be considered for the highest honour and honorarium accorded to a Fellow in India under this Fellowship.\nAreas of Research and Eligible Projects:\nThe selected Fellows will normally work on a project that benefits the Nodal Institution in terms of unraveling its resources. The subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship, though he/she will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions, as well.\nIf the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Fellow otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship would recommend the Fellow to such other institution(s). In rare cases, where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the Fellows, the second institution may be deemed to be the \u2018Co-institution\u2019 and the two may sign a Tripartite MoU regarding Intellectual Property, Publication, Credit sharing, facilities, etc. but accounting shall be with the Nodal Institution.\nSince the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution.\nAt the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject.
